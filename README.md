# Blackjack

This is a basic implementation of the classic card game, Blackjack. At the start of each round, the player places a bet before the cards are dealt. After the bets are collected, the player is dealt 2 cards (face up) and the dealer is dealt 2 cards (1 card face up & 1 card face down). The player always goes first and can choose to 'Hit' (draw a card) or 'Stand' (end turn) with the goal of beating the dealers score without going over 21 points. Currently in the process of finishing the core functionalities and implementing new features.
